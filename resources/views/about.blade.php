            <h2 class="title">History of EOSO</h2>
            <h5 class="description">The journey of Each one Save One started from 11th Oct 2016 when some curious
              students aiming to bring smiles on the innocent faces of the underprivileged children. This aim of
              uplifting the children was undertaken by two college students of NMIMS Shirpur Campus, Mr. Suchit Arora
              and Mr. Praneet Singh under the guidance of Mrs Payal Rahul Dande who has always been helping and
              motivating the youth. In the initial days lots of research and surveys were conducted in various schools
              and ashrams to understand basic requirements needed by the children in a small town of Maharashtra. The
              first drive was conducted to distribute 400 warm woolen blankets at a school in Shirpur, Maharashtra.
              This experience was heartfelt by the volunteer with relief and contentment that the winters for the kind
              children wouldn’t be harsh this year, in the next drive 60 sets of Painting & Drawing material along
              with Notebooks and school bags to the Specially abled students at Waghadi Ashram to draw their hearts
              out. As and when we felt the need to provide basic knowledge there were various drives which were held
              such as Cleanliness Drive, Oral Hygiene Drive which helped the children be more aware of their Oral
              Health, to make them aware of the Swine Flu Epidemic, Precautions and Safety measures, Furnace Boiler
              for availability hot water. As EOSO family expanded various projects such as Paathshala, a student
              oriented programme which helps the children to widen their horizon and to get to know about the world
              beyond, it also boosts up their courage and motivates them to strive for better. Hence EOSO has been a
              platform for all to make their share of contribution for a better tomorrow.</h5>
